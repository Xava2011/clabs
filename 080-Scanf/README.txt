,,You will find that the scan conversion specifications are not as
  complete as the print conversion specifications. Too often, you
  want to exercise control over an input scan. Or you may find it
  impossible to determine where a scan failed well enough to
  recover properly from the failure. [...] Be prepared [...] to
  give up on the scan functions beyond a point. their usefulness,
  over the years, has proved to be limited.''
