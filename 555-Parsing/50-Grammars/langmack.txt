Catalog of Compiler Construction Products - Fifteenth Issue

This posting may be reproduced in any form without further permission, as
long as it is left unchanged.

July 1999, Olaf Langmack.

FIFTEENTH ISSUE

This catalog lists products and services for the construction of programming
language compilers and related programming tools. It covers compiler
generators, corresponding grammars, reusable parts of compilers, reusable
parts of other programming tools and related consulting or programming
services.

The catalog provides only technical information. Potential customers have to
inquire at the given address about prices and licensing policies. (For a
catalog of free software see the "Catalog of Free Compilers and
Interpreters".)

All the listed products are available now in a form suitable for production
use. They shall exhibit professional quality and have long term support.

The entries are submitted voluntarily. Apart from tracking complaints about
inappropriate entries no quality control of the entries is applied. Therefore
I do not assume any liability for listed entries.

The catalog is posted monthly on comp.compilers and is available online at
http://www.feinarbeit.de/CCCP/ . Updates are incorporated at least twice a year. If
you want to submit an update send the filled form to langmack@feinarbeit.de.
Updates that do not make use of the form or do not comply with the guidelines
given at the end will not be considered. Entries have to be provided as ASCII
text files. If they shall be incorporated into the respective Web pages, they
have to be provided as HTML files as well. Detailed instructions are given at
the end of this document.

Tool

     Recursive Descent Compiler generator
     RDP

     Features

          RDP takes an attributed very-extended BNF and analyses it for LL(1)
          conformance providing detailed error and warning messages. It
          outputs ANSI C and links against a library of general purpose
          routines that provide set handling, command line switch processing,
          symbol table management and more. RDP is very easy to use.

     Distribution

          All source in ANSI C, compiler-compiler source in BNF, various
          examples. Complete distributions available from
          ftp://ftp.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk/pub/rdp.

Tool

     C compiler and related tools
     User Retargetable Development Tools II (URDT)

     Features

          The URDT set includes an ANSI C compiler, compactor, assembler,
          linker, and related tools. It allows you to "roll your own" C
          compiler and related tools. You do retargets by writing text files,
          which are read in by these programs when they run. Please see our
          web page at "http://www.archelon.com" for details.

     Distribution and Platform

          Binary versions available for DOS (32 bit), SunOs 4.x.x, Solaris
          2.x, HP-UX. Source licences available, as well.

Component

     C compiler
     MCC ANSI C compiler

     Features

          You target MCC to a specific machine by writing a text file which
          includes a machine description and code tables. You do not need to
          know compiler internals. The compiler includes output macros which
          allow you to output code for any assembler, as well as our own. Can
          handle a wide variety of machines, including DSPs and
          microprammable machines.

     Distribution and Platform

          Part of URDT (see above).

Component

     Compactor/Scheduler/Optimizing Assembler
     MCPACK Compactor/Scheduler

     Features

          MCPACK gives you a way to implement low level translator tools. It
          reads a control file, which you must write. The control file
          describes the layout of instructions and provides procedures for
          translating input statements into instructions. You may provide
          rules for scheduling and compaction in the file.

     Distribution and Platform

          Part of URDT (see above).

Component

     Assembler
     MCASR assembler

     Features

          MCASR is a "bit-stuffing" assembler, driven from a user written
          text file which describes the fields of the instructions. An
          instruction word can be up to 256 bits wide and may contain
          multiple relocatable fields. Such a field may be set with only a
          subset of the bits of the full address.

     Distribution and Platform

          Part of URDT (see above).

Component

     Linker
     MCLINK linker

     Features

          MCLINK supports up to eight independent overlapping memory address
          spaces, so it can, for instance, easily support DSP architectures
          with X and Y memories.

     Distribution and Platform

          Part of URDT (see above).

Related Services

     Archelon provides consulting services for the development of compilers
     and related tools. In particular, we provide a retargeting service for
     our User Regargetable Development Tools.

Tool

     Parser generator
     ANTLR 1.33

     Features

          ANTLR constructs human-readable recursive-descent parsers in C or
          C++ from predicated-LL(k>1) grammars. Many context-sensitive
          languages and languages requiring infinite lookahead are
          recognizable with ANTLR parsers. Can automatically build ASTs. Has
          new and powerful error recovery mechanism.

     Distribution

          Complete C source code, totally public domain. See WEB for
          download.

     Platform

          Any platform that compiles C or C++. Specific Mac port available as
          well as binaries/makefiles for PC compilers.

Tool

     Parser generator
     ANTLR 2.00

     Features

          Meta-language has been redesigned. Will incorporate SORCERER tree
          rewrite rules also by mid May 1997.

     Distribution

Tool

     AST transformer / walker (source-to-source translation)
     SORCERER

     Features

          A SORCERER grammar describes AST content and structure. You may
          annotate the grammar with actions to effect a translation or
          manipulate the tree itself. Generates recursive-descent tree
          walkers in C or C++ (soon Java). Same flavor/syntax as ANTLR. Not
          tied to a parser generator or any other tool.

     Distribution

          Complete C source code, totally public domain. See WEB for
          dwonload.

     Platform
